Question: 1


Given the following code:

class Test{

private int m;

public static void fun() {

// some code...

}

}

How can the member variable m be accessible directly in the method fun()?


A. change private int m to protected int m

B. change private int m to public int m

C. change private int m to static int m

The throws keyword should be used when declaration of a method. In the declaration IOException and its superclass Exception can be used. 

Correct Answer: D,E 42 of 60 

 


Question: 43


Given the following expression:

String f = null;

Which of the following expressions will throw an exception?


A. f == null | f.length()>10

B. f != null | f.length()>10

C. f == null || f.length()>10

D. f != null || f.length()>10 

Explanation: 


The operator || perform short-circuit logical expressions. If the first subexpression is true the second subexpression is skipped, for the entire expression is true when the first subexpression is true. The operator | doesn't perform short-circuit logical expressions. Both of the two subexpressions are performed. Because the f is null the expression f.length() will cause an exception is thrown.
